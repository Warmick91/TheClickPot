# The Click Pot

I want to expand my professional horizons, and there's no better way to do it than by applying and honing my skills through personal projects. A personal project becomes a truly interesting endeavor when we build it on something we already love, right?

I've been an avid gamer for as long as I can remember. Games are an important part of my identity, and I believe that media in general—but especially video games—offer a uniquely precise way of experiencing time filled with emotions. I want to play games, I want to talk about them, and this is what I hope this blog will become: a platform where I can share my passion for electronic entertainment.
